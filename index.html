  <h1>This was GOODBIDS.</h1>
  <p>
    GOODBIDS was a novel approach to online fundraising - positive auctions,
    with a twist. Every bid was a donation, and every donation increased in
    value.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the auctions we ran, nonprofits like <a class="link" href="https://www.savethechildren.org/" target="_blank">
      Save The Children</a>
     and <a class="link" href="https://www.charitywater.org" target="_blank">
      Charity:Water</a>
      raised thousands of dollars with online auctions that took minutes to set
    up. Supporters won prizes like Apple Watches, appearances in Future Best-Selling novels, and concert tickets, all for a fraction of their market
    value.
  </p>

  <p>
    Goodbids was conceived by Seth Godin, and brought to life by an
    international team of ruckus-makers: 
    
    <ul>
    <li>
      Anne Marie Cruz 
    </li>
    <li>
      Avaleen Morris 
    </li>
    <li>
      Blessing Abeng 
    </li>
    <li>
      Fani Theofanidou 
    </li>

      Scott Perry
    </li>
    <li>
      The team at Viget
    </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    While the original intent was to commercialize the idea, we've now pivoted to
    open-sourcing the code with the hope that someone will bring this idea to the
    world. The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/Good-Bids/goodbids" target="_blank" class="link">
      here</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to our domain, to the name Goodbids and to any other
    trademarks or partnerships, but you're welcome to fork the code and build your
    own platform. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, more than ever, we need leadership, generosity and
    connection. Thanks for making a ruckus.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>All the best,</p>
  <p>The GOODBIDS team</p>
